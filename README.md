# Healthcare Diagnosis Prediction with Machine Learning

This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to predict diagnostic outcomes using patient health records. The goal is to assist healthcare providers in early detection and improve clinical decision-making.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Early diagnosis of certain conditions can significantly improve treatment outcomes. In this project, we develop models to predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with a specific condition based on clinical data.

## 🧠 Model Approach
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- Feature Engineering  
- Train-Test Split & Cross Validation  
- Model Development: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  
- Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, AUC

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📈 Results
- Achieved 15% improvement over baseline in diagnostic accuracy  
- Identified key clinical indicators contributing to prediction outcomes  
- Visualized model performance and feature importance
